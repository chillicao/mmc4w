# Is MMC4W For You?

Like all software, MMC4W was written with a few assumptions in mind.

 - A functioning MPD server exists.  
 - The server is not password protected.  
 - The library consists of managed files.  
 - The music codec is one that supports metadata.  

If the music library is comprised of random files that may or may not contain basic metadata, you probably should use some other client.

If the music library is well-curated with reasonably complete song metadata, MMC4W will likely work just fine.

I use it every day on three different servers.  The libraries are pretty consistent and are all using the FLAC codec.

One thing is for sure, for what you are paying, you've nothing much to lose if it doesn't work with your server.

Good luck!
