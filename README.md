## Minimal MPD Client for Windows
### October 14, 2023 - This is a new project, not perfect in any way.
There is a lot of detail work to do before it's "finished finished".

I needed a tiny set of controls for a couple of different **[Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/)** (MPD) servers here.  I could not find a Windows MPD client that was as simple as what I wanted.  

This one is written in Python, using Tkinter and is about as basic as you can get.

It does exactly what I need and nothing more.
