## Minimal MPD Client for Windows

I needed a tiny set of controls for a couple of different Music Player Daemon (MPD) servers here.  I could not find a Windows MPD client that was as simple as what I wanted.  

This one is written in Python, using Tkinter and is about as basic as you can get.

It does exactly what I need and nothing more.
