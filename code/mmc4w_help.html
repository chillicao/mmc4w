<h1>MMC4W - Minimal MPD Client for Windows</h1>
<h2>In a world with tons of music apps, MMC4W stands alone.</h2>
<p><strong>MMC4W</strong> is first and foremost <strong>Minimal</strong>.  That means it does what I need and nothing more.  </p>
<p><strong>MMC4W</strong> is a MPD Client.  To be clear, you must have access to a running MPD server for this app to be of any value to you.</p>
<p>MMC4W is open source, and does not send any data out to anyone anywhere.  It connects only to the MPD server you specify in the configuration file. (mmc4w.ini)</p>
<p>It takes up very little room on my screen. The interface contains the basic required buttons to control a MPD server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vol +, Vol -, Play, Stop, Prev, Pause, Next and Quit.</li>
<li>A 'Mode' button eliminates the Windows title bar if desired.</li>
<li>An 'Art' button toggles a very small window that displays embedded album art.  <ul>
<li>If no embedded art is found, MMC4W's logo is displayed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The <strong>'File'</strong> menu contains these functions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Configure - opens mmc4w.ini for editing. Uses Windows configured .ini editor. (Notepad or similar)</li>
<li>Select Server - Allows you to select a server from the list in mmc4w.ini. Prompts you to select a playlist also.</li>
<li>Toggle Logging - Toggles logging On or Off.  Restart the app after toggling.</li>
<li>Exit - Same as the 'Quit' button: exits the app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>There is a <strong>'Look'</strong> menu that has these functions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn Random On</li>
<li>Turn Random Off</li>
<li>Toggle Titlebar</li>
<li>Reload Current Title</li>
<li>Set Non-Standard Port</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 'Help' menu contains:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Help - This document.</li>
<li>About - Look here to find your installation path and version number.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Things MMC4W Does NOT Do:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Constantly poll the server. - Based on song duration, <strong>MMC4W</strong> checks back with the server when the song is ending.</li>
<li>Discover servers.  You need to know the IP address of any servers you wish to control.</li>
<li>Search the music database.  <strong>MMC4W</strong> is a playlist-based app.  You select the playlist you want to listen to and it plays it.</li>
<li>Update the MPD database.  There are many other ways to do that.  It could be an option later, but for now, no.</li>
<li>Edit tags, display lyrics, get art from the web, display artist info, provide stats on servers, wash dishes or vacuum floors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>First Run Process</h2>
<p>MMC4W ships with a blank .ini file.  The first time you run it, it will pop up a box like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The Configure dialog." src="./_internal/edit_config_dialog.png" /></p>
<p>When you press the 'OK' button, <strong>mmc4w</strong> opens mmc4w.ini using the default Windows text editor.  On my system it's Notepad++.  If you never specified an editor for .ini files, you will likely be informed of that fact at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Notepad</strong> is perfectly fine for this job.  Word processors like <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> or <strong>Wordpad</strong> will cause you problems.  </p>
<p>Do not use a word processor.  Only use a text editor that edits and saves plain ASCII text.</p>
<p>You need to type in your preferred MPD server's IP address in the [basic] section as shown.  Be sure to put that trailing comma on there.</p>
<p><img alt="inside the mmc4w.ini file" src="./_internal/config_ini_basics.png" /></p>
<p>If you have more than one server, just string those IP addresses together as seen there.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the playlists or ports.  Type your server info in the [basic] section, save and close the file.</p>
<p>Restart <strong>MMC4W</strong>.  Go to the <strong>File</strong> menu and click <strong>Select Server</strong>.  You'll be prompted to select one of the servers you just put into the <strong>mmc4w.ini</strong> file.  Click on one.</p>
<p><img alt="Select server and playlist" src="./_internal/select_playlist.png" /></p>
<p>Next you are prompted to select one of that server's playlists.  Click on it.  Now you can click the <strong>'Play'</strong> button.</p>
<h3>Normal Operation</h3>
<p>After you press <strong>'Play'</strong>, there's not much to do but enjoy the music.</p>
<p>MMC4W will show you these basic statistics, alternating between the two lines of text shown in these two images:</p>
<p><img alt="Track name and Artist" src="./_internal/screen_1.png" /></br></br><span style="color:green; font-size:smaller;">Track name and Artist.</span></p>
<p><img alt="Server IP, status, playlist." src="./_internal/screen_2.png" /></br></br><span style="color:green; font-size:smaller;">Server, Status, PlayList and Elapsed vs Duration in seconds.</span></p>
<p>The <strong>'Art'</strong> button toggles the small album art window.</p>
<p>The <strong>'Mode'</strong> button toggles the titlebar like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Titlebar on." src="./_internal/titlebar.png" /></p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>Logging can be enabled by using the '<strong>Toggle Logging</strong>' option under the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img alt="Toggle Logging" src="./_internal/toggle_logging.png" /></p>
<p>After using the '<strong>Toggle Logging</strong>' option, restart MMC4W.</p>
<p>MMC4W currently supports two levels of logging: <strong>INFO</strong> and <strong>DEBUG</strong>.  INFO lists basic actions that should be occurring as they occur.  DEBUG adds another layer of potentially useful data to the stream.</p>
<p><img alt="Setting the Log Level" src="./_internal/logging.png" /></p>
<p>To set the logging level, use the '<strong>Configure</strong>' option and edit the <strong>mmc4w.ini</strong> file.  Type either 'info' or 'debug' where indicated (without quotes).</p>
<p>The resulting log file (<strong>mmc4w.log</strong>) can be found in the <strong>_internal</strong> folder in the installation folder.  The log file is deleted and started fresh each time you start <strong>MMC4W</strong>.  If you toggle Off logging, the last log file will remain until you delete it or create a new one by toggling logging On again.</p>
<p>The DEBUG file (<strong>mmc4w_DEBUG.log</strong>) does not start fresh with each run, and is not deleted.</p>
<h3>A Couple of Other Random Options</h3>
<p>Under the <strong>'Look'</strong> menu there are options to turn MPD's <strong>Random Mode</strong> on or off.</p>
<p>The <strong>'Set Non-Standard Port'</strong> option opens a pop-up that provides the details to set any port other than 6600 which is the default MPD port.  Most people will never use this.</p>
<h2>Notes About What Happens Under the Hood</h2>
<p>When you press '<strong>Play</strong>', MMC4W reaches out to the configured server and asks for data on the current song.  Then it asks for a status report.  From the returned data, MMC4W calculates how much longer the current song should be playing.  If album art is being displayed, it attempts to get art embedded in the song.  If that is successful, it displays the art.  If not, it displays the MMC4W logo.</p>
<p>MMC4W uses the Python <strong>threading</strong> module to run a timer in conjunction with a small set of global variables.  In this way we're able to keep the interface satisfactorily snappy and avoid having to poll the server every few seconds to determine if a new song is playing.</p>
<p>The Tkinter interface runs continuously waiting for button presses.  Blocking code (like sleep(10)) is avoided at all cost.  As a result, things work.  From my chair, it's perfect.  We'll see how long that perspective lasts, shan't we?</p>
<p>The design of this utility is intentionally simple.  I'm sure there are several 'better' ways it can be done, I just don't know what they are. </p>
<h3>Minutia</h3>
<p>MMC4W was developed and tested in Windows 10.  <strong>MPD</strong> is running on three different computers here, one i7 Ubuntu, one i3 Ubuntu and one Raspberry Pi.  My music library is made up exclusively of FLAC files.  I rip my CD's (remember those?) using <a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">Music Bee</a>.  I create a 'folder.jpg' file for each album and embed the art in the songs using <strong><a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">MP3TAG</a></strong> or <strong>Music Bee</strong> depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using this as much as I do.<br><br></p>
