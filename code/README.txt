Minimal MPD Client - v2.0.4

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v2.0.4)

The album name is displayed now in True Blue Album Mode instead of a playlist name.
Playlist Build Mode now shows a list of playlists that do NOT contain the current song.
The method of writing the art to the art window is much improved. As I learn, I apply knowledge.
The art window is created typically once per session, rather than create/destroy multiple times.
I finally added a Tool menu option to ask MPD to update the database.

I'm working on a Linux variant, and am using on Mint (Cinnamon) and Ubuntu it as I tweak.  I'm trying to make the Windows code and the Linux code as close to the same as possible.  Good things are happening as a result.
