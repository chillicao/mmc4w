    v0.9.2 is a continuing-development release.
    
Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v0.8.1)

- Errors occurring when attempting to connect to a server that is down are now handled more humanely.
- Using the Mode button when the Art window was off didn't work.  Now it does.
- Tweaked debug logging.
- Improved joining a currently playing server.

I feel like I'm down to managing fringe cases now.  It's a good place.
