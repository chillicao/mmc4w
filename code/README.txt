Minimal MPD Client - v0.9.3

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v0.9.3)

- Removed the 'Lookup results' playlist text.  Configured PL is always shown now, regardless of whether the current song is the result of a search.
- Fixed failure to check and follow server 'random' status at startup.
- Updated the Help text to this release.
- Improved the feedback on volume. Buttons display volume unless it's at 50.
- Corrected sequence errors in INFO level log output.  Increased some detail.
- Modified the status text display. Random, rePeat, Single and Consume now show up there. Uppercase means ON.
- Tweaks and more tweaks . . . hopefully down to the end of that for a while.
