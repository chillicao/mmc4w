Minimal MPD Client - v0.9.6

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v0.9.6)

A new PL Build Mode that allows you to add and delete songs from saved playlists without stopping playback.
I find this is the most natural way to manage playlists.  Just click Delete or Add and move on.

The "Show Songs in Last Playlist" option in the Look Menu lets you jump to a specific song with a scroll and click.

I think I've finally got all the functions I expect to find in a music player here in this little app.
