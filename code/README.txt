Minimal MPD Client - v0.8.0

This is a 'huge leap forward' release in terms of my ultimate goals.

- Expanded search to allow for searching by title or artist.
- Achieved my goal of an album mode.  Plays a selected album start to finish.
- Added track numbers to the title/artist text.
- The text area background is white for 'random mode' and navy for 'True Blue Album Mode', aka not-random mode.
- Added a Tools menu and shifted some things around.
- App does a better job of paying attention to its surroundings.  You'll see that at the end of things, mostly.  Actually you may NOT see it, which would be the point in that case.
- The volume buttons will now show you when you're getting near either end of the volume range.
- MMC4W now remembers where you last had your windows positioned.  Hit 'Mode', move them around, then hit 'Mode' again.
