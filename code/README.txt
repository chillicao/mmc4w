Minimal MPD Client - v2.0.5

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v2.0.5)

Once I started using the new PL Build Mode, I realized I needed to take a step further.  So now the green and red buttons are irrelevant.  You get two lists.  If you want to add to a PL, select it from the right-side list.  If you want to delete the current song from any PL it is in, select that PL from the left-side list.  Much simpler.

v2.0.4 Release Notes:
The album name is displayed now in True Blue Album Mode instead of a playlist name.
Playlist Build Mode now shows lists of playlists that do and do not contain the current song.
The method of writing the art to the art window is much improved. As I learn, I apply knowledge.
The art window is created typically once per session, rather than create/destroy multiple times.
I finally added a Tool menu option to ask MPD to update the database.

I'm working on a Linux variant, and am using on Mint (Cinnamon) and Ubuntu it as I tweak.  I'm trying to make the Windows code and the Linux code as close to the same as possible.  Good things are happening as a result.
