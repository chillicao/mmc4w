Minimal MPD Client - v2.0.9

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v2.0.9)

v2.0.9 
  - Expanded commands that can be used in search windows.  'help;' tells all.
  - Renamed menus to names I like. Moved options around so they almost make sense.
  - Discovered and fixed bugs related to art window.
  - Improved Linux experience. Configuration changes exit MMC4W. Reload applies them.
  - In Linux, Mode button also exits so reloading can pick up titlebar change.
      More testing on other WM's needed.
  - Finally got "scaling factor" working.  Set scale factor by sizing main win. In Config menu.
  - Massive redo of the help document.  New pics required.
  - Resolved Help and About window sizing on scaled displays.
  - Resolved a couple of bugs uncovered by LuSP19 related to brand new MPD installs.

v2.0.8 
  - Added a 'Close' button to Outputs and Server windows.
  - This allows you to make multiple changes to outputs 
    and change your mind about which server you want.
