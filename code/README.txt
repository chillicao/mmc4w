Minimal MPD Client - v0.0.7

This is an interim release. I know more changes are coming soon.

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v0.0.6)

- Added the ability to search for and play a single title.
- Added a menu option to quickly return to the previously selected playlist.
- Added 'Select Playlist' to the File menu so it's easy do that.

I want to make an 'album mode'.  Maybe add song search by artist.
All that's later.  This works for today.
