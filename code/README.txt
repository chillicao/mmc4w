Minimal MPD Client - v2.0.8

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v2.0.8)

v2.0.8 adds a 'Close' button to Outputs and Server windows.
 - This allows you to make multiple changes to outputs 
    and change your mind about which server you want.

v2.0.7 was a quick bug-fix.  
  - Replaced os.path with pathlib.
  - Re-coded connection error to accept 'Already Connected' (as it should) and move on.
